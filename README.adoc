My take on https://adventofcode.com/2022/ in Go. As usual, i don't particularly
care if i provide my solutions _fast_, i try to be _correct_ on the first
answer, and care for being runtime efficient.

Answers are hard coded into the unit tests.

Slightly rearranging my code to separate the intersect() and prio() part.
Haskell teaches you that there is no such thing as f(a, b).
Karma is to be found within functional composition.
`intersect(a, b, c) === intersect(intersect(a, b), c)`

26 ns per byte, equals 39 MHz. At a marker size of 14, garbage collection seems
to kick in because of the hashmap being larger than default.

== Day 07

Ok, pretty straightforward, but unit tests fail because of 'total size of at
most 100000. I misread as "larger than 100000", because we are searching for big
ones, no?

First try fails miserably.
A couple of checks all look good.
In the end, i search for a working implementation, and trace back my error.
I do not cater for empty intermediate directories, i.e. i don't account for `b`
in `/a/b/c/d.ext` if `b` has no files in it.
Second try works.

Second puzzle unit tests ran successfully the first time.

== Day 10

Upgraded to Fedora 37, which brings Go 1.19.3.

Took me a while (40 min) to figure out that the register changes _after_ the
second cycle.
Interestingly, no off-by-one error this time.

2300 ns/op for 138 instructions is 17 ns per instruction, i.e. 60 MHz.

When checking which instruction to execute, comparing the command like `op ==
"noop"` is the same speed as `op[0] == 'n'`.

Rolling our own strconv.Atoi() parser:

I just realized everything i contributed so far has been on my reddit account,
not my google account as in previous years. I just lost 7000 places, but i am at

Part 2 returns characters as ASCII art, so this would require human interaction.

Instead, let's use OCR to automate this step.
Tesseract will succeed, but requires host OS support.
Gosseract will fail for whatever reason https://github.com/otiai10/gosseract/issues/266[Issue 266].
https://gitlab.com/jhinrichsen/aococr[AOC OCR] to the rescue.

== Day 11

`Monkey` parsing was a bit of an typing effort, but a no-brainer.
Looking at Monkey #0 and #1, and their Operations (`* 19` and `+ 6`) make me
start a simple handrolled parser.
For Monkey #3 (`new = old * old`) i switched from this basic parser to the Go
internal `eval()` equivalent.
While every Python programmer is familiar with `eval()`, the Go equivalent is
rather unknown.

But yes, Go is self hosted, which means its compiler is written in Go.
So you can use Go to parse *and evaluate* an expressions.
Remember that `new = old * old` is a statement, and `old * old` an expression.

----
// Eval uses Go's internal compiler to evaluate an expression.
func Eval(expr string, m map[string]float64) float64 {
	// wipe global scope
	types.Universe = types.NewScope(nil, token.NoPos, token.NoPos, "universe") (1)

	for k, v := range m {
		c := types.NewConst(
			token.NoPos,
			nil,
			k,
			types.Typ[types.Float64],
			constant.MakeFloat64(float64(v)))
		types.Universe.Insert(c)
	}

	fs := token.NewFileSet()
	tv, err := types.Eval(fs, nil, token.NoPos, expr)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	n, _ := constant.Float64Val(tv.Value)
	return n
}
----
(1) Do not forget to redeclare global between calls, otherwise `old` will be
evaluated once, and the cached value returned for the next call.

For part #2, this approach blows miserably.
I started using an `int` based implementation, but it resulted in integer
overflow.
Switching from `int` to `float64` did not improve the situation, somewhere up
and above `1e376` even float64 reaches its end of precision.

In earlier years, i would have switched to arbitrary precision library.
But all in all the number crunching part of AOC has vanished.
I remember years 201x when CPU and fan went ballistic for 15 minutes to
calculate a solution, but nowadays typical runtimes are usually subsecond.
In addition, all four divisors in the example are primes, and you don't fight
primes with CPU.
So, obviously, switching to https://pkg.go.dev/math/big[arbitrary-precision
arithmetic]
(big numbers) seems a dead end.

I took a peek at the reddit hint channel, where people talked about abstract
number theory, and x^2^ divided by n can be reduced to mumble mumble mumble.

So here's why i don't do part 2:

* It seems you need to look at the actual expressions to derive a solution to
  keep your worry levels low
* I understand the division part, and taking a short circuit on the expression,
  but the result is passed to the next monkey, and this result is different. I
  accept you can bring down worry level `1e376` to, say, `15`, but then this is
  passed to the next monkey, and `1e376+3` is definitely different from `15+3`.
* I do not know how to write an abstract algebraic resolver
* I do not want to know how to write one

Please go ahead and read about the Xerox JBIG2 problem, and optimization issues.

So for now, another unsolved puzzle in a long line of unresolved puzzles.

Time to apply the `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` pattern.

== Day12

Looks like a path finding problem, Dijkstra to the rescue.
I grep'ed my old AOCs, and 2016's day 13 was the same category.
Back then i used an https://github.com/beefsack/go-astar[external A* library].
Although only 2 contributors, i picked it because of its nice examples that fit
well.
This time, none of the standard examples worked out, so i had to dive deeper
into the library.

=== beefsack's go-astar library

The function signature to calculate a path is

----
func Path(from, to Pather) (path []Pather, distance float64, found bool)
----

No surprises so far. Pather is an dominant interface

----
type Pather interface {
	// PathNeighbors returns the direct neighboring nodes of this node which
	// can be pathed to.
	PathNeighbors() []Pather

----

Of course, Pather need to find their neighbors somehow.
But this single interface signature leads to a problem.
In path finding, you usually have an area, often a grid, and cells.
In our Day 13 puzzle, the puzzle input is the area, and S (the starting point),
and E (the end point) are two cells in this area.
Now, should area or cell implement the Pather interface?
Obviously, only cells have neighbours.
But cells need access to the world to find their neighbors.

In the library examples, the area is called World, and a cell is called Tile.
The world has references to Tiles, and each and every Tile has a backref to the
world.
On top, you have the Day 13 grid itself, so we are housekeeping three data
lakes.
Anyway, we need to ship this thing out the door, so why bother.
Go being a statically typed language and everything, both `go build` and `go
vet` agree we have made it.

But.

CAUTION: panic() somewhere deep inside the guts of the external library.

=== Workaround #1

The library keeps track of the Day 13 struct that implements Pather.
It does so by storing cells in an internal map.
And Go's map has some limitations when it comes to storing.
Long story short you can only store something that is comparable by ==.
And channels, slices, and functions (just to name a few) cannot be compared
using ==.
Our Day12 struct has a slice to all of its navigatable neighbors.

Slices cannot be compared, but arrays can.
So, instead of an undefined number of []neighbors, we know that we can move only
left, right, top, or down, so [4]neighbors, returning the array as a slice as
dicated by the Pather interface: neighbors[:].

CAUTION: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

=== Workaround #2

The panic() is again buried deeply inside the guts of the external library.
Ok, seems as if  2 passengers in a car built for 4 is not going to happen.
Hand peeling off unused neighbors, and returning the slice neighbors[0:n].

CAUTION: panic: runtime error: hash of unhashable type

Seems as if we made it past the initial stage, but when applying the heuristic
part of A*, the priority queue reads

----
func (pq *priorityQueue) Push(x interface{}) {
----

Well, one of my personal don'ts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&t=456s[interface{} says nothing]
Even in C, the void * carries more information than interface{}.
You know it is a pointer, at least.
interface{} in Go has about the same information as void in C.
Nothing.
Anything.
Both.
One or the other.
I never use it, because i am stupid and i NEED the compiler, its type checker,
and go vet.

=== Workaround #3

Throw the beefstack library out of the window and migrate to a library that has
a better user interface.

=== gonum to the rescue

https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/path[gonum] seems like a reasonable
choice.
489 forks, 6.2k stars.
A* by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael.
Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Joseph Kruskal, Jin Y. Yen, the who-is-who of path
finding.

The signature for A* reads
----
func AStar(s, t graph.Node, g traverse.Graph, h Heuristic) (path Shortest, expanded int)
----

s source, t target node, our cell.

g traverse Graph, our world.

h, the add-on compared to Dijkstra, and a default
https://github.com/gonum/gonum/blob/v0.12.0/graph/path/a_star.go#L99[
NullHeuristic].

Plus, i still have an open position for a good DAG lib, so i'll try gonum.

gonum lacks some example documentation, but other than that it works like a
charm.

== Day 17

Got part 1 right on first try.
For part 2, 1_000_000_000_000 cycles does not sound reasonable, even in Go.

TODO: There must be some sort of cycle.
I'd keep the surface of the tower as a 7 numbers wide pattern, plus the shape
ID, plus the resulting surface, plus the increase in height.

=== Optimization

Replaced shape maps with slices and eliminated temporary Sprite allocations in
collision detection. Changed from creating intermediate Sprite objects via
Translate() to direct position checking with slices.

== Day 18

Got part 2 wrong, i think i need to cater for interior air holes that stick
together.

TODO: move from 0,0,0 to maxX, maxY, maxZ until the first non-empty cube is
reached.
Then, keeping left hand on the object, flood-fill along the border to count
surface elements.

== Day 19

TODO: need to maxmize the throughput. Keep a list of quotients for each factory,
and build new stuff to minimize current quotients against optimal quotient.

=== Optimization

Parallelized blueprint processing using goroutines. Each blueprint is processed
independently in its own goroutine, reducing wall-clock time.

== Day 20

So easy the problem, so nasty the implementation.
I started copy()ing slices around, using an working buffer in analogy to a
offscreen image, and filling like

----
count int

add = func(is []int) {
    count += copy(dst[count:], is)
}
----

Unfortunately, i never got the indexes and the wrapping and the left/right
correct.

For a second strategy, i projected the mix to a bubble sort, i.e. the number is
swapped with it immediate neighbour to the left or to the right N times.

When wrapping would occur, it is replaced with swapping to the other direction.

Bug was in the mixing algorithm: movement calculations must use modulo (len-1)
since the element is removed before calculating the new position. Rewrote to
use Node struct tracking original indices for proper order processing.

=== Optimization

Replaced slice-based implementation with circular doubly-linked list.
Original used linear search O(n) and slice splice operations O(n) for each
move, resulting in O(n²) per mix. Linked list provides O(1) insert/remove
and direct node access via array of pointers.

BFS pathfinding through valley with moving blizzards.

=== Tries

|===
| Attempt | Value  | Status
| 1       | 300    | Wrong (too high)
| 2       | 299    | Correct
|===

First attempt failed due to incorrect blizzard wrapping logic. The modulo
arithmetic didn't handle negative coordinates properly, causing blizzards to
appear in incorrect positions (including wall rows). This created a wrong
simulation of the blizzard field, causing BFS to find a suboptimal path and
return 300 instead of the correct 299.

Fixed by properly converting to 0-based coordinates, applying correct modulo
`((x % mod) + mod) % mod`, then converting back to 1-based. Added comprehensive
tests for all 19 intermediate blizzard states from the example walkthrough to
prevent regression.

== Day 21

Nice example for channels.
Reading from a close()d channel returns the empty value without blocking.

Got caught in triple logic (wall, walk, wrap) in a map[complex128]bool.

== Day 25

Trying a + operator in the Snafu domain, i.e. without conversion to decimal.
Got it right on the first try.
The algorithm is pretty slow, about 15 times slower as a conversion to dec and then using the CPU's ADD operation.
